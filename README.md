Neighbors
=========

This is my first solo project on Rails. WOOT!

How it works
------------
This app will aloow a user to select a city, and state (and an optional neighborhood), and it will show data from zillow.com (data tbd).

the user can then "save" certain places he/she likes, and can go view these lists.
